    "summary": "Based on the text provided, here is a concise summary focusing on key insights, methods, and findings:\n\nThis research details the development of an automated plant disease detection system to assist farmers. The key insight is that traditional manual inspection is slow and subjective, whereas a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can provide a fast, accurate diagnosis from leaf images.\n\nThe method involved training a CNN model on a dataset of leaf images to classify them as healthy or diseased. This trained model was then integrated into a user-friendly web application using the Flask framework, allowing farmers to upload images for analysis.\n\nThe system was found to be highly accurate. Its key finding is its ability to provide farmers with a comprehensive and actionable diagnosis, including the disease name, preventive measures, and the plant's life span, empowering them to take timely action and reduce crop loss."
